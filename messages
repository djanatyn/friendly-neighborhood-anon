hey! you're rad! don't beat yourself up. instead, beat up criminals attacking old people. that would make you a hero imo
you're hotter than pizza straight out of the oven, and way smarter too! ;)
hey, listen up. if anybody tries to be mean to you today, just tickle them. they'll be so shocked they won't know what to do :)
congratulations, you won a free ipad! okay, just kidding, but i hope you have a great day anyway! :)
tumblrbot, what does the scanner say about tumblr user #{user}'s power level? WHAT! 9000!? you must be pretty cool ;)
you know, even if you do mess up sometimes, you do a lot of really cool stuff. everybody messes up, but not everybody does something cool. you're a good kid, tumblr user #{user}.
you know how they say if you don't have anything nice to say, say nothing at all? well i have a lot of nice things to say about you! <3
don't forget that you're a special, unique invidual, and you deserve to have a fantastic day! :)
today, you have the ability to do anything you would like. take advantage of it, and do something totally rad; i dare you
